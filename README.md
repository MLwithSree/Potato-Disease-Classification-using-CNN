 🥔 Potato Disease Classification using CNN

This project is a deep learning solution to classify potato plant leaves into three categories:

- **Healthy**
- **Early Blight**
- **Late Blight**

Built with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, this model helps in early disease detection, enabling farmers and agricultural researchers to take timely actions.
